Show that the negation of an unsatisfiable compound proposition is a tautology and the negation of a compound proposition that is a tautology is unsatisfiable.


t is tautology if all cobimbination give true
s is satisfiable has at least one solution
u is unsatisfiable if all cobimbination give false

¬u ↔ t
t → s
¬t → ¬s
