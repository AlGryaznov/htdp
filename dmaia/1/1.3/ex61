The following sentence is taken from the speciﬁcation of
a telephone system: “If the directory database is opened,
then the monitor is put in a closed state, if the sys-
tem is not in its initial state.” This speciﬁcation is hard
to understand because it involves two conditional state-
ments. Find an equivalent, easier-to-understand speciﬁ-
cation that involves disjunctions and negations but not
conditional statements.


“If the directory database is opened,
then the monitor is put in a closed state, if the sys-
tem is not in its initial state.”
